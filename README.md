# Wine-Quality-Predictor

The data set is from University of California Irvine's Machine Learning Repository: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009

I used pandas and numpy to clean the data and perform EDA. Then I used scikit learn to split, preprocess, and predict the quality of wine using Decision Tree Classifier. The prediction had a confidence score of 50-60%.
